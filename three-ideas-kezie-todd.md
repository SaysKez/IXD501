## DIY Synth

### Overview
In a world where everyone wants the latest gadgets, even children, DIY Synth is an opportunity for kids to not only own the latest tech but *build* it.

A hands on learning experience, this educational kit comes with everything you need to create your own synthesizer. From customisable casing to snap together circuits, DIY Synth is a project parents and children can build together. Simple instructions distill not only the build process but the science behind how it works so anyone can follow along. Once you've completed the basic build, you'll have the knowledge and skills to begin experimenting with your own wild creations and make music out of anything.


### Pros
- Synthesizers and music production have always intrigued me and this would be an amazing opportunity to get hands on and learn more about them.
- I've never made a physical product and this would be quite the crash course in everything from electronics to the packaging.
- There is a market for educational STEM/STEAM toys for both children and adults ([Meccano](http://www.meccano.com/?locale=en_UK), [Lego](https://www.lego.com/), [Nintendo Labo](https://labo.nintendo.com/), or Kickstarter hits like [Hackaball](https://www.madebymany.com/stories/hackaball--2) and [Raspi Boy](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/583173617/raspi-boy-retro-handheld-emulation-console-electro)) ready to be tapped into if I position this right.
- Maker communities and magazines could provide fertile ground for research and promotion.

### Cons
- I know very little about... all of this. Making a physical product, electronics, Raspberry Pis, soldering, etc. would all be new to me. This would be a great way to learn but could be too much to execute well in the limited time frame.
- As I currently possess no equipment, skills, or materials, the product would require more resources to get off the ground plus capital to produce at any sort of scale.
- It is difficult to estimate time and effort without knowing much about the mechanics.
- There are some similar kits already available like the [Synth Kit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Will-Save-Us-Synth-Educational/dp/B01186HLCO) or ready made children's toys like [blipbox](https://blipblox.com/). The educational variety seems to have a high learning curve so a potential angle could be making learning about synths more accessible. On the other hand, I also considered a DIY Smartwatch instead and I could pivot the project that way instead if the synth angle doesn't work.

### How might it be built?
[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), or [Makey Makey](https://makeymakey.com/) will almost certainly form the foundation. Whichever I choose, I'll be teaching myself from scratch but it's something I would like to know more about. [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) is an existing code-based music creation tool for Raspberry Pi I might be able to leverage and build upon. Queen's University also hosts monthly Raspberry Pi Jams where I might be able to get help and also conduct user research with the families that attend.

In particular, I'd like to achieve something more like [Makey Makey](https://makeymakey.com/)'s level of simplicity, with the ability to potentially turn anything into a controller for the synth. However, I don't know if a dedicated synth kit would differentiate enough from the base Makey Makey.

The key differentiator may end being the tight focus of the kit and ease of use. The instructions and casing then become equally important. The kit should be easy to build, guided, and customisable like the [Rhythmo Beatbox](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rhythmo/beatbox-by-rhythmo-diy-cardboard-midi-controller-kit), a successful Kickstarter, or [Nintendo Labo](https://labo.nintendo.com/). The Beatbox in particular gives me pause because it feels like it might be a bit too similar (except for a slightly older audience). Pivoting to a DIY Smartwatch might be a more unique option but the music angle is more interesting to me.


### Who’s it for?
The kit is primarily aimed at 8-12 year olds and their dads. DIY Synth should appeal to both and be a project they can complete together. For the kids it's a fun toy they can feel proud for building, meanwhile parents are happier to purchase a toy that is educational and something they can take part in with their children.

A crossover market could be the maker community and millenial tech workers who may be interested in the idea but not have the neccessary skills or materials to complete tutorials they see online. If they have young families of their own, this will be the perfect purchase.

### What’s the business model?
The kit could be a single purchase which, if marketed right, the kids will want and the parents will be willing to pay for as it is educational and something they can do together.

If successful, this could be developed into expandable, customisable kits. Build a speaker, smartwatch, drone, gameboy, etc. using the same core framework and principles. Or perhaps the tools or an additional music creation application to create your own new instruments?

This seems most suited to Kickstarter as it would be capital intensive to produce at any sort of scale and is more of a niche, STEM toy. Offering the kits at lower prices to schools or Raspberry Pi events might be another option to help promote and sell it.

## Bug Eyes

### Overview
Learn about insects by seeing the world through their eyes.

I've always been fascinated by the creepy crawlies with whom we share the planet. They are easy to overlook yet they outnumber us 200 million to one and are a crucial part of the ecosystem without which we could not survive. Now their survival depends on us.

Bug Eyes is an immersive educational experience for children, letting them see the world through a bug's perspectives while teaching them about the insects and the environment. Choose your bug (endangered honey bee, flitting dragonfly, cunning spider, hardworking ant, etc) and learn about them through the Bug Eyes book and accompanying activities. 

Slip on your 'bug vision' goggles to see through compound eyes, spy UV trails to pollen, or explore the world through scents instead of colours. Discover facts in the book about each bug which are only made visible when viewing through their eyes or explore your own back garden as if you were a honey bee while learning what you can do to help save the ecosystem we share.

### Pros
- Entomology (study of insects) has been an interest of mine since I was little. I can draw on experience teaching myself about the topic and learn more while sharing my love of the subject.
- I adore illustrated reference books and this would be an opportunity to learn the skills necessary to create one.
- I believe there is a market for educational books and apps for young children, especially in the vein of artistic, illustrated children's reference books such as [Animalium](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Animalium-Welcome-Museum-Jenny-Broom/dp/1787411648/ref=asc_df_1787411648/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310810203983&hvpos=1o8&hvnetw=g&hvrand=3447051993842378705&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1007274&hvtargid=pla-465675935706&psc=1&th=1&psc=1) (that can attract parents and the adult audience as well) which Bug Eyes could tap into with a unique, interactive angle.
- Bug Eyes could tie in nicely with the growing interest in the environment, nature, and the climate.
- As a self-contained book, this could be a product I can continue to market and sell for (mostly) passive income after university.

### Cons
- The 'bug vision' goggles are an interesting challenge. This would probably require an app (filters of some sort you can look through?) or physical view-altering glasses, neither of which I have experience making.
- I have never written or illustrated a book of any sort before so I will need to learn about that as well as how to structure educational material.
- I have never created a physical book or ebook, but I am interested in learning. A physical book particularly intrigues me (though offers a steeper challenge and cost).
- Buying ISBNs and registering a trademark will be another topic (and potential expense) necessary to bring this project to life but also an opportunity to learn more about what goes into making a real product.

### How might it be built?
The idea is to create a Bug Eyes ebook in PDF, ePub and .mobi formats. This will be a substantial undertaking, requiring learning Adobe InDesign, which I have very little experience in but something I would like to know more about.

For the illustrations, I picture something like [Owen Davey's](https://flyingeyebooks.com/creator/owen-davey/) brilliant nature vector work. My own vector illustrations tend to be simpler so I will need to refine my skills in that area but am confident I can achieve that with some master apprentice exercises.

The 'bug vision' goggles will be where some coding comes in and will likely require a mobile application of some sort that can leverage a phone's camera to alter what you see. I have heard good things about the new [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) which might help make development easier and there are plenty of dedicated tutorials such as [Design+Code's SwiftUI course](https://designcode.io/) or the [Swift Playground](https://www.apple.com/uk/swift/playgrounds/).

If possible, I would love to integrate the 'bug vision' into a wearable goggles accessory similar to [Google Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/) or [Nintendo Labo VR](https://labo.nintendo.com/kits/vr-kit/) which kids could customise to look like the bugs. I started researching origami and paper engineering over the summer so I might be able to draw upon and enhance those skills to create a modular, cardboard construction children can build.

### Who’s it for?
The target audience is 6-11 year olds. The illustration, facts, and interactive actvities should attract children while the quality and educational value convince parents to buy it. While the material should not be difficult to understand, I want it to be informative and go deeper into interesting facts so even older kids or interested adults can enjoy sharing it with younger siblings/children. Books like [Smart About Sharks](https://flyingeyebooks.com/shop/smart-about-sharks/?), [The Book of Bees](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Book-Bees-Piotr-Socha/dp/0500650950/ref=pd_sbs_14_49?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0500650950&pd_rd_r=b4240711-5b33-45df-aeb8-6458516ad3c1&pd_rd_w=aI0hu&pd_rd_wg=7FQRB&pf_rd_p=2b420a2f-6593-478e-8b5f-cb43865ff16f&pf_rd_r=BW8HNYBYCJ99J7GBR58Z&psc=1&refRID=BW8HNYBYCJ99J7GBR58Z), or [The Illustrated Compendium of Amazing Animal Facts](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Illustrated-Compendium-Amazing-Animal-Facts/dp/1607748320/ref=pd_sbs_14_34?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1607748320&pd_rd_r=b4240711-5b33-45df-aeb8-6458516ad3c1&pd_rd_w=aI0hu&pd_rd_wg=7FQRB&pf_rd_p=2b420a2f-6593-478e-8b5f-cb43865ff16f&pf_rd_r=BW8HNYBYCJ99J7GBR58Z&psc=1&refRID=BW8HNYBYCJ99J7GBR58Z) (to name a few) do this successfully.

Another potential angle might be homeschoolers and teachers (and the shops supplying that learning material), looking for an engaging introduction to natural sciences.

I will need to do more market research around this but speaking with potential readers and researching existing children's reference books should help narrow that down.


### What’s the business model?
I could see Bug Eyes going in a number of different direction, depending on the target audience and exact delivery medium. Assuming a book and 'bug vision' app, there could potentially be a number of tiers:

- The app and ebook bundle, divided up into chapters. In-app purchases unlock chapters on additional insects and their associated 'eyes' in the app.
- The buildable 'bug vision' goggles (perhaps as instructions or the physical kit).
- A deluxe kit containing the printed book with all the chapters plus the 'bug vision' app and buildable goggles.

If successful, there could also be supplementary kits containing eggs/seeds to attract insects and act upon the learnings from the book and turn your garden into a bug paradise. Or maybe another series focusing on animals and their unique sight or even other senses.

## Ghost Trails

### Overview
A narrative experience bringing the mystery to reality.

You are a detective. Each week, the personal effects of a 'ghost' are delivered to your desk. Pick through the train tickets, torn letters, and blood-spattered scarves to gather the clues and solve the puzzle. Reality blurs as each clue unlocks beacons in real world places picked based upon your GPS location. Visit the last restaurant they ate at or the train station where they died to view memories from the past and new insights into the mystery.

Who were they? What happened to them? It's up to you to decide in this branching storyline. The question is will your decisions come back to haunt you?

### Pros
- An amazing opportunity to combine and dig deep into learning about a whole host of my interests: experience design, storytelling, and game design.
- I want to do something different and beyond anything I've done before for final year. Creating a new kind of immersive experience ticks that box and will allow me to really push my skills in totally new areas.
- Games and apps are a crowded market but creating an immersive narrative experience customised to your location is a unique selling point which could capatilise on the ['experience economy'](https://hbr.org/1998/07/welcome-to-the-experience-economy) and interest in interactive narrative media such as [Netflix's Bandersnatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror:_Bandersnatch) or curated mystery tours and escape rooms.

### Cons
- A bit 'out there' and potentially niche. I need to design it carefully to balance the level of commitment and ensure it will be accessible for both those who want to dive deep into every aspect of the narrative and those who are just curious and want to experience a quick thrill.
- Blurring the line between story, immersive experience, and game, there is not one clear angle so a plan for promotion and monetization will require extra care.
- The delivery mechanism, if I use location-triggered clues, will likely require an app of some sort. This opens up another whole area to explore which I know nothing about around app development, location services, and potentially accounts and purchases. This could prove too much to execute at the level I would like within the limited timeframe.
- Dynamic, location-based triggers could be tricky to develop and backfire depending on where the user is.
- There is a lot here. At the bare minimum I will need to write the story, plan several murders (fictional, of course), break those down into clues, design the artefacts and unlockables, on top of designing and programing an app and website. I don't want to spread myself too thin and make the final product suffer for it.

### How might it be built?
Depending on the visual grammar of the experience, I picture using Adobe Illustrator (if taking a more stylised approach akin to [Papers, Please](https://papersplea.se/)) or Adobe Photoshop (for which I picture a more newspaper collage aesthetic akin to the work of [Mike McQuade](https://mikemcquade.com/) or something like the innovative text thriller app [Device 6](http://simogo.com/work/device-6/)). I am not well versed in Adobe Photoshop so this will be an opportunity to learn and push myself to augment my vector work with other styles.

Physical artefacts could also be a potential option which would be amazing for immersiveness but also open up another whole can of worms when it comes to sourcing and making artefacts that feel authentic. Options like [Newspaper Club](https://www.newspaperclub.com/), providing custom tabloid and newspaper style printing for smaller runs, and other such services could be an option so I can focus on the design and not worry about handmaking everything.

The biggest challenge will likely be the development. I want to build it for real so you can actually experience the story but I do not have experience developing apps or more advanced websites with a database to track things like accounts and payments. One potential option might be to see how far I can get with the growing 'no code' trend, leveraging tools like [tadabase](https://tadabase.io/) or [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) to handle the backend. The app and location triggers is where the real challenge will lie but if I can put myself through a coding crash course, I believe I can leverage the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation) and [Geolocation API](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/native-hardware/user-location) for the necessary information. Games like [Pokemon Go and Ingress leverage geolocations](https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/why-your-local-church-and-water-towers-are-pokemon-go-gyms-and-pokestops/) in a not dissimilar manner but the trick would be making this dynamic so it works at locations personalised to the user. The [Google Maps Platform](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/gaming/) has a solution for gaming as well and links in with [Unity](https://unity.com/), which could be just what I'm looking for if I teach myself the necessary skills for both.

### Who’s it for?
I feel like there is a market, even if niche, for immersive experiences capatilising on the curiosity around VR, escape room trends, and the [growing culture of prefering experiences to things](https://www.thedrum.com/bauer/marketing-millennials-importance-experiences). With that in mind, 35 and under is likely the best starting point as they value experiences more. Other potential avenues to research and leverage:

- Fans of mystery, thrillers, and speculative fiction such as the works of [China Mieville](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/33918.China_Mi_ville) or [James Patterson](https://www.jamespatterson.com/).
- Fans of true crime podcasts (this could potentially be a promotion strategy).
- Fans of [Bandersnatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror:_Bandersnatch) and interactive media.
- Indie narrative gamers.

### What’s the business model?
To identify the best business model, I feel like I need to define and research the target market more and discover how best to sell the experience to them. Using the idea of regular deliveries to advance the story on a schedule, it feels something like a subscription service. The first 'chapter' could be free and then you could buy or subscribe to additional chapters.

A subscription service for the physical artefacts might be another option for avid fans or potentially a collector's edition with a box full of physical artefacts and all the chapters.
